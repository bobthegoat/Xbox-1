// The purpose of the XboxOneControllerDriver class is to attach to the USB interface
// and provide actual HID driver functionality. Since the class derives from IOUSBHIDDriver,
// most of it is already implemented for us. We know that the controller behaves differently
// from a USB HID gamepad in three ways:
//
// * it doesn't have a report descriptor;
// * it needs to be sent a hello message;
// * it sends reports that aren't state reports.
//
// We override three methods to fix this: `newReportDescriptor` (to provide a correct report
// descriptor), `handleStart` (to send the hello message) and `handleReport` (to handle
// reports that aren't state reports).
//
// Additionally, we override `setPowerState` to wake up the controller after sleep.
//
// IOUSBHIDDriver already handles cases like disconnects, which is quite nifty.

// This class does not attach to the USB device: it attaches to its first interface.
// This is an important distinction, as the device starts in an unconfigured state.
// As the controller exposes no interface in an unconfigured state, we need another
// driver to configure it. AppleUSBComposite does just that, except that it won't match
// by default on devices with a vendor-specific class. Fortunately, nothing prevents us
// from giving it a new matching personality from our own Info.plist to make it match:
// no need to write an identical driver ourselves.
